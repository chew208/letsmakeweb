        <p>I am a pro polar bear wrestler. I am undefeated in my weight class, which is 140 lbs.
             Some people wonder how I manage to stay ahead of my opponents. Well, I tell them two
            little facts. One, I have a strict trainig regiments to hone my body into an instrument
            of brutal combat; and two, their  bears, they can't argue results even though Betty cann
            get rowty at times.</p>

                <p>You may be asking youself why would anybody put themselves through that torture. Well there are a couple reasons why I do it, I like physical exercise that their fighting provides and the lifestyle needed to maintain a trim figure and the mental side effects of the narrow chemicals that are released as a byproduct of the exercise. Not to mention the exhilaration of knowing that your title as world champion could be taken away at any second. Now some might say that the bear rustling circuit is a brutal and dangerous environment to exist in, and I would absolutely agree because there have been some times where I have suffered grievous wounds that would be career ending for some, but the challenge of activity is its own reward.</p>

                <p>Now you might be wondering how I got my start in their bear wrestling. Like many of you I was born to two great parents, but as I grew and find my in the world, I developed an unquenchable desire to push the boundaries and become the best I ever could at something. I started doing some research on what type of world records were out there and as I looked I realized that I could do what ever was in the Guinness book blood on those documents were played out. I had to do something that nobody else had done before. So I decided to travel the world and look for an obscure hobby known to a small group so I could bring it into the public spotlight. I met a group of people in Russia who were amateur polar bear fighters and hit me that this is the perfect stage to launch my endeavor. And after a couple of brutal challenging and body scarring years, I was able to gain a following and was able to the claw, pon very much intended, to the top.</p>
